# Tests

The tests are largely separated into three categories: general tests, issue tests, and regression tests.

General tests are a mixed can of various tests. Regression tests make sure nothing regresses, and issue tests test stuff for a specific issue or PR, and may be a regression test to make sure nothing breaks if stuff changes.
