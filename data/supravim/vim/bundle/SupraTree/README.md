## üöÄ Installation

To install SupraTree, you can use a Vim9 plugin manager like `vim-plug` or `dein.vim`, or a simple file-based manager like `supraload` or `pathogen`.

### Using `vim-plug`

Add the following line to your `.vimrc` or `init.vim` file:

`vim
Plug 'your_github_username/supraTree'
`

Then, restart Vim and run `:PlugInstall`.

### Using `supraload` (or `pathogen`)

1.  Navigate to your Vim plugins directory. For `supraload`, this would be `~/.vim/bundle/` (or similar, depending on your setup).
2.  Clone the repository directly into this directory:

`bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle/
git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/supraTree.git
`

This method automatically loads the plugin when Vim starts, similar to how `pathogen` works.
